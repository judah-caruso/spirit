# Spirit

An *in spirit* port to Gerbil Scheme of Evan Hanson's R7RS command line parsing library, Optimism. 

### Description

Spirit is a minimal library, allowing you to easily parse various types of command line arguments. It also uses some of Gerbil Scheme's features, and will use more in the future.

### Installation
To install spirit, run:
`gxpkg install github.com/kyoto-shift/spirit`

This will install two packages:
* Spirit 
* Spirit/Getopt (A getopt-styled parser)
